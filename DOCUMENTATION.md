# Enterprise Monitoring Starter Documentation

## Overview

The **Enterprise Monitoring Starter** is a scalable application designed to monitor, collect, and visualize metrics and logs from distributed systems. It provides real-time insights into system health, performance, and availability, enabling proactive incident response and capacity planning.

---

## Features

### Metrics Collection
- **System Metrics:** Collects CPU, memory, disk, and network usage from servers and hosts.
- **Application Metrics:** Gathers application-specific metrics such as request rates, error counts, and latency.
- **Custom Metrics:** Supports user-defined metrics for specialized monitoring needs.
- **Multi-source Support:** Aggregates data from various platforms and environments.

### Log Aggregation
- **Centralized Logging:** Collects logs from distributed applications and infrastructure into a single location.
- **Search & Filtering:** Enables fast searching and filtering of logs for troubleshooting.
- **Log Parsing:** Supports parsing and structuring of log data for easier analysis.
- **Retention Policies:** Configurable log retention and archival.

### Alerting
- **Threshold-based Alerts:** Triggers notifications when metrics exceed defined thresholds.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies unusual patterns or behaviors in metrics and logs.
- **Notification Channels:** Integrates with email, Slack, PagerDuty, and other services for alert delivery.
- **Alert Management:** Allows silencing, escalation, and acknowledgment of alerts.

### Dashboards
- **Interactive Visualization:** Provides real-time charts, graphs, and tables for metrics and logs.
- **Custom Dashboards:** Users can create and customize dashboards for specific use cases.
- **Drill-down Capabilities:** Enables detailed exploration of data for root cause analysis.
- **Sharing & Collaboration:** Dashboards can be shared with teams or exported.

### Extensibility
- **Plugin Architecture:** Supports plugins for new data sources, outputs, and processing logic.
- **API Integrations:** Exposes REST APIs for integration with external tools and automation.
- **Custom Widgets:** Allows development of custom dashboard components.

### Security
- **Role-based Access Control:** Restricts access based on user roles and permissions.
- **Secure Data Transmission:** All data between agents and server is encrypted using TLS.
- **Authentication:** Supports OAuth2 and JWT for secure user authentication.
- **Audit Logging:** Tracks user actions and configuration changes for compliance.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd enterprise-monitoring-starter
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start Services:**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

---

## Configuration

- **Central Server:** `config/server.yml` – Configure server settings, storage, and integrations.
- **Agents:** `config/agent.yml` – Define what metrics and logs to collect on each host.
- **Alert Rules:** `config/alerts.yml` – Set up alert conditions and notification channels.
- **Dashboards:** `config/dashboards.json` – Manage dashboard layouts and widgets.

---

## Usage

- **Access Dashboard:** Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view and interact with dashboards.
- **API Reference:** See `docs/api.md` for REST endpoints to automate monitoring tasks.
- **Add Data Sources:** Register new sources via the dashboard or API for expanded coverage.

---

## Extending

- **Plugins:** Place custom plugins in `plugins/` and register in `config/plugins.yml` to add new capabilities.
- **Integrations:** Use the API to connect with external systems (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty) for notifications and automation.

---

## Security

- **Authentication:** Supports OAuth2 and JWT for secure user login.
- **Encryption:** All data in transit uses TLS to protect sensitive information.
- **Access Control:** Define user roles and permissions in `config/users.yml` to restrict access.
- **Audit Logging:** Monitors and records user actions for compliance and troubleshooting.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Logs:** Check `logs/` directory for server and agent logs to diagnose issues.
- **Health Checks:** Use `/api/health` endpoint to verify system status.
- **Support:** Open issues on the project repository for help and bug reports.
